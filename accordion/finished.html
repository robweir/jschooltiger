    			<p>Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. A certain point of view! Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.</p>

    			<p> Use your aggressive feelings, boy! Let the hate flow through you. Obi-Wan has taught you well. I will not fight you, father. You are unwise to lower your defenses. Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. There is no conflict. You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. Good. Good.</p>

    			<p> I don't know how we're going to get out of this one. Oww! Chewie! That was no laser blast! Something hit us. Han, get up here! Come on, Chewie! Asteroids! Oh, no! Chewie, set two-seven-one. What are you doing? You're not actually going into an asteroid field? They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they? You don't have to do this to impress me. Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating an asteroid field is approximately three thousand, seven hundred and twenty to one. Never tell me the odds!</p>
