	 	<h1>"Like drinking from a firehose:" Buy John Darkow's latest book</h1>
		<img src="cover.jpg"/>

		<p>John Darkow has created and published more than 7,000 political cartoons in a career dating back to the early 1980s, both here in Columbia and in San Antonio. He is a master at slaying the outrageous and the ridiculous through his art and his humor.</p>

		<p>His approach is pure and simple. “I try to have fun and hope people have fun reading the cartoons,” he says.</p>

		<p>The last year has offered him a fire hose of material. It’s our pleasure to offer this collection of his award-winning work. We hope you enjoy it.</p>

		<p>To buy his book online, <a href="#">click here</a>, or to order over the phone, call the Missourian at 573-882-5700. You can also stop by our offices at 221 S. Eighth Street to pick one up in person.</p>
